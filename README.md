# Happy-Tech-Company
The company HappyTech is growing and advertises a significant number of positions. Therefore, the number of applications they have to deal with is increasing too. The companyâ€™s policy is to respond to both the successful and unsuccessful applications by sending them feedback. As writing up letters for every applicant takes a lot of time, the company identified an ontology that could be used by a software application to generate the feedback. The feedback application will be used by anybody involved in reviewing the applications.
